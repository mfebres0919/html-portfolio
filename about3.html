	<h1>How it All Started</h1>

	<h2>Education and Background</h2>
	<h3>Middle School & High School</h3>
	<p>Ever since I was younger, I've always been into things that allowed room for creativity. 
		For example, my favorite video game to play back then was called "Animal Jam." Within the
		Animal Jam community, there were these things that big Animal Jam creators would partake in
		that were called <strong>AJMV'S</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>AJMV'S</strong> stood for Animal Jam Music Videos. This allowed me to create things
	that I felt were visually appealing to me. So, I guess in short, I loved creating. As time went on,
	and especially as I got older, AJMV'S became a thing of the past. But this era of my life is something
	I'll cherish forever! It was the beginning of my path when it came to creating  things.
	</p>
	<p>From that day on, I continued to find ways to express myself. I joined the band in my
	middle school where I grew a deep love and passion for music. There, I played the french horn,
	but I had to make a decsion between that or sports. I come from a family who has always been atheltic
	in every way, so the choice was more so made for me.	
	</p>
	<p>In high school, I did a multitude of sports, such as basketball, volleyball, swimming,
		you name it! My senior year, I found myself back in the marching band where I was able
		to experince the love I felt for music once again before it was time to say goodbye and
		head over to college.

	<h3>Prairie View A&M University</h3>
	<p>When I got to Prairie View A&M University, I decided that I would major in <strong>
		Civil Engineering</strong>. When I got into the courses, I realized that there was 
		something lacking.. <STRONG>CREATIVITY</STRONG>!
	</p>

	<p>I remember taking a course back in high school called Engineering Design where my teacher
		would give us engineering drawings to creat on a software called CAD (Computer Aided
		Design). This subject really intriuiged me because I was able to create 3D models of different
		objects! Not only this, but I got to learn the importance of 3D printing, also known as 
		<strong>Additive Manufacturing</strong>.
	</p>

	<p>Because of this experience, I quickly made the switch to Mechanical Engineering the second
		semester of my sophomore year. It was immediatley everything I loved and more because it 
		allowed me to tap into that creative side where I could visually see something I was developing/creating.
		It wasn't until my senior year where I discovered the amazing things that you can do with <strong>Software
		Engineering.</strong>
	</p>

	<p>With all that being said, here I am now, almost 4 years into my undergrad where I've grown
		a passion for web development. I still love mechanical engineering, but doing this on the side
		is something I want to continue to invest in.
