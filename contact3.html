<h1>Thank You!</h1>
<p>I just want to end this by saying thank you so much for taking the time to 
	look at the websites that I've created. This is really important for me because 
	my main goal is to create websites for small businesses who might need a little
	more help but can't afford spending crazy amounts of money.
</p>

<p>Your support doesn't go unnoticed and I look forward to hearing from you
	soon!
</p>
